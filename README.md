## The evolution of forecasting for decision making in dynamic environments
#### Andrew R. Tilman, Vítor V. Vasconcelos, Erol Akçay, and Joshua B. Plotkin

Climate change and technological advances are reshaping ecosystems and societies. Strategic choices that were best
yesterday may be sub-optimal tomorrow; and environmental conditions that were once taken for granted may soon
cease to exist. In dynamic settings, how people choose behavioral strategies has important consequences for environmental
dynamics. Economic and evolutionary theories make similar predictions for strategic behavior in a static
environment, even though one approach assumes perfect rationality and the other assumes no cognition whatsoever;
but predictions differ in a dynamic environment. Here we explore a middle ground between economic rationality and
evolutionary myopia. Starting from a population of myopic agents, we study the evolutionary viability of a new type
that forms environmental forecasts when making strategic decisions. We show that forecasting types can have an
advantage in changing environments, even when the act of forecasting is costly. Forecasting types can invade but rarely
overtake the population, producing a stable coexistence with myopic types. Moreover, forecasting fosters collective
intelligence by providing a public good which reduces the amplitude of environmental oscillations and often increases
mean payoffs to forecasting and myopic types alike. We interpret our results for understanding the evolution of
different modes of decision-making such as forecasting. And we discuss implications for the management of environmental
systems of societal importance.
